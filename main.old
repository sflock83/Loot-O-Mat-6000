"""
This script automates the process of looting legendary items in the game Enshrouded.

The script uses the pyautogui, pydirectinput, requests, and pyperclip libraries.

The script locates an image on the screen, 
verifies if the loot on the screen matches an item in the loot list,
and moves the character forward and interacts with a chest.

The script also includes functions to reload the game and navigate through the main menu,
perform OCR (Optical Character Recognition) on an image,
and send a notification to the user using the pushover.net API.

The script is not currently used in the main script.

The script can be run from the command line.

Example:
    $ python main.py
